Low GPS accuracy is the main problem of using AGRO NAVIGATION APP. If the phone is arranged in the cabin of the vehicle, the GPS signal may be shielded by the top plate of the cabin.

External receiver can be placed on the top of the tractor and connected to the phone via bluetooth.

Because the AGRO NAVIGATION app accepts a NMEA data stream, any external receiver can be connected to it.

## Components

To create your own GPS AGRO NAVIGATION receiver you will be wiring only two modules. The GPS module (from u-blox) and the bluetooth UART module.

GPS: Neo-6M (low accuracy, external antenna required), NEO-7M, NEO-8M
Bluetooth: HM-10

The easiest way is to use the module with built -in GPS/GNSS antenna and USB connector

## Wiring

Connect the power pins (VCC, GND) of both modules. Then connect TX-pin GPS to RX-pin Bluetooth.

## Case printing

You can 3d print the case, if you want.

## Setup GPS module

Download u-center from https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center (Windows only), and set up your GPS module.

## AGRO NAVIGATION app connection

First install the app on your phone.

In the parallel driving app: Settings -> Connect external GPS receiverâ€¦ 

The connection icon is displayed on the left on the main screen when the GPS receiver is connected.
